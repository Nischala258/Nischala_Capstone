## Title: AI Event Planner - Intelligent Event Planning System using LLMs

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered event planning assistant that helps users create complete event plans just by describing what they need in plain English. For example, if you say "Plan a birthday party for 30 people," the system automatically generates everything you need: a guest list, schedule, budget breakdown, menu suggestions, venue recommendations, and even a shopping list. It works by understanding your request, finding similar past events, and using that knowledge to create a personalized plan tailored to your needs.

## Reason for picking up this project

This project perfectly demonstrates all the key concepts we learned in this course. Event planning requires understanding natural language (Prompting), organizing information into structured formats (Structured Output), finding relevant examples from past events (Semantic Search), using those examples to improve suggestions (RAG), performing calculations like budget estimates (Tool Calling), managing a multi-step planning process (LangGraph), and debugging the entire workflow (LangSmith). 

I chose this project because event planning is something everyone can relate to, we've all struggled with organizing parties, meetings, or celebrations. By applying LLM concepts to this real-world problem, I can show how these technologies can make complex planning tasks much easier and more accessible to everyone.
